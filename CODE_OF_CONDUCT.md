# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age.

As long as you have blue eyes and are above average intelligence.

If you are a feminist, trans, or otherwise identify as an atack helicopter or will cause trouble, find another repo.
