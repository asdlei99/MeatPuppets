# MeatPuppets

## Abstract
_MeatPuppets_ is a combined Rts (Real Time Strategy) and Fps (First Person Shooter) game.

It is based on small planets, with circumfrences measured in hundreds of meters. This is to ensure that players cannot hide in corners.

Players build up bases and units and contest for finite resources. 

## Win Condition
A player wins the game when he controls more than half the surface area, or has destroyed all enemy buildings.


## Building
The app will build out of the box on Windows 10+ machines. Main target is Xbox One and DirectX 11.

## Gameplay
Players build up bases that include resource extraction and unit production, like StarCraft, but the user also has the ability to take over control of individual units for fine control.

This is admittedly a large and ambitious project. It has only started and first playable is expected Q1 2020.
See the wiki for details.
